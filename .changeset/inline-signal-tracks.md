`LayerAnimation.signal()` and `.colorSignal()` now accept a signal object (`Signal.fromArray`, `Signal.builder`, …) as well as a name registered with `comp.addSignal`. Before, passing the object produced a meaningless handle id and the track silently did nothing (or picked up an unrelated signal). The object is carried on its track and registered with the program under a generated `inline_signal_N` id, so specs stay plain JSON. Values that are neither a signal nor a name now throw.
