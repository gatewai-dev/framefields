### Patch Changes

- Physical 3D look, gradients, mattes, transitions and lint for agents:

  - `Layer.environment(preset)` / `Lighting.studio|soft|sunset|dramatic()`: GGX PBR with a procedural studio environment, emissive, exposure and tone mapping (PBR Neutral, AgX, ACES), soft shadow maps (`castShadow`), HDR bloom and fog. glTF normal, metallic-roughness, occlusion and emissive maps are now used.
  - `Color` helpers (`oklch`, `mix`, `ramp`, `lighten`, `contrast`, `readableOn`, …); `hsl()`, `oklch()` and space-separated `rgb()` accepted everywhere; color keyframes blend in OKLab.
  - CSS `linear-` / `radial-` / `conic-gradient()` with up to 8 stops on any background or shape fill.
  - Track mattes (`withMatte(layer, "alpha" | "alpha-inverted" | "luma" | "luma-inverted")`), on 2D and 3D layers; 3D layers keep their depth.
  - `Layer.sequence([...])` with `Transition.crossfade|push|slide|zoom|whip|wipe|iris|fadeThrough`.
  - `.animate()` merges with existing tracks; `FontManager.measure()` text metrics.
  - `comp.lint()` (also in `renderVideo({ qa })`): unreadable colors/gradients, low-contrast text, off-canvas layers, shadow and environment misuse, static tracks.
  - Fixes: `Layer.shape({ fill })` was ignored; `Layer3D.plane` dropped material options; stale 3D camera buffer reuse between frames.

### Patch Changes

- 985e6be: `LayerAnimation.signal()` and `.colorSignal()` now accept a signal object (`Signal.fromArray`, `Signal.builder`, …) as well as a name registered with `comp.addSignal`. Before, passing the object produced a meaningless handle id and the track silently did nothing (or picked up an unrelated signal). The object is carried on its track and registered with the program under a generated `inline_signal_N` id, so specs stay plain JSON. Values that are neither a signal nor a name now throw.
