Asset and font paths no longer depend on the `BASE_URL` and `R2_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` environment variables, left over from the Gatewai web app. With `BASE_URL` set, a font registered from an absolute path was fetched from `$BASE_URL/<path>`, and when that failed the engine quietly used a font from the `R2_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` CDN instead of the project's file. Absolute paths are now always read from disk, and Lottie sources and fonts are used as given instead of being prefixed with `http://localhost:8081`.

Removed from `@framefields/client-utils`: `getEnv`, `BASE_URL`, `R2_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, `configureAssetUrls` and the `options` argument of `GetAssetEndpoint`, `GetFontAssetUrl`, `resolveMediaSourceUrl` and `ResolveFileDataUrl`. Removed from `@framefields/compositions`: `getFontUrl`.
